ALETHEIA AGENT PIPELINE
=======================

Two autonomous agents with human-in-the-loop review at each stage.


STAGE 1: DISCOVERY AGENT
------------------------
Runs autonomously to find external research leads.

Sources monitored (28 total):
  - Journals: JSE, J. Parapsychology, JNDS, EdgeScience, JCS
  - Archives: CIA Reading Room, NSA, FBI Vault, UK National Archives, DIA FOIA
  - Organizations: SSE, PA, IONS, IANDS, Rhine, UVA DOPS
  - Preprints: arXiv (q-bio.NC), PsyArXiv, OSF
  - Conferences: PA, SSE, MUFON, IANDS

Researchers tracked (24 total):
  - Parapsychology: Radin, Cardeña, Bem, Utts, Mossbridge, Tressoldi
  - NDE: Greyson, Parnia, van Lommel, Sartori
  - Skeptics: French, Wiseman, Blackmore
  - UFO/UAP: Vallée, Nolan, Loeb, Pasulka
  - Geophysical: Persinger, Derr
  - Consciousness: Kastrup, Hoffman, Chalmers
  - Remote Viewing: May, Schwartz

Outputs:
  - Papers from tracked researchers
  - Cross-domain connections with hypotheses
  - FOIA documents from government archives
  - Citation trails (2 levels deep)

                    ▼

STAGE 2: LEADS REVIEW QUEUE (/agent/discovery/leads)
----------------------------------------------------
Human reviews discovered leads.

Actions:
  - APPROVE     → Hand off to Research Agent for testing
  - INVESTIGATE → Flag for deeper research
  - REJECT      → Discard

Quality scored 0-100 based on:
  - Source reliability
  - Named authors
  - Domain relevance
  - Methodology indicators

                    ▼

STAGE 3: RESEARCH AGENT
-----------------------
Tests hypotheses against existing data (174k+ records).

Process:
  1. Pattern scanning across investigation domains
  2. Hypothesis generation via Claude API
  3. Statistical testing (Chi-squared, permutation tests)
  4. Confound checking:
     - Reporting bias
     - Population density
     - Temporal patterns
     - Geographic clustering
  5. Holdout validation (train/test split)

Thresholds:
  - p-value < 0.01
  - Effect size > 0.3
  - Must survive confound checks
  - Must replicate on holdout

                    ▼

STAGE 4: FINDINGS REVIEW QUEUE (/agent/review)
----------------------------------------------
Human reviews validated findings.

Actions:
  - APPROVE      → Creates tracked Prediction
  - REJECT       → With reason (duplicate, methodology, insufficient evidence, etc.)
  - REQUEST INFO → Ask agent for more analysis

Confidence scored based on:
  - Effect size (25%)
  - P-value strength (25%)
  - Confound survival rate (25%)
  - Holdout replication (25%)
  - Max 85% (epistemic humility)

                    ▼

STAGE 5: PREDICTIONS (/predictions)
-----------------------------------
Approved findings become falsifiable predictions.

Tracked with:
  - Pre-registered methodology
  - Test criteria
  - Deadline
  - Resolution status

Can be:
  - Tested by community
  - Disputed via jury system
  - Verified or falsified


DATA ACQUISITION (parallel process)
-----------------------------------
When findings fail verification checks:

  Research Agent detects gap
           ▼
  Creates acquisition request
           ▼
  Human approves source (/agent/acquire)
           ▼
  System fetches external data
           ▼
  Data ingested for re-testing


SUMMARY
-------
Discovery Agent  →  Leads Queue    →  Research Agent  →  Findings Queue  →  Predictions
(finds leads)       (human review)    (tests hypotheses)  (human review)     (tracked)

Human-in-the-loop at EVERY decision point.
No autonomous creation of public predictions.
