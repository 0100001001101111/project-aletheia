Subject: Technical Guide: Mapping Your Research to Aletheia Schemas

Dear [Name],

The strength of Aletheia lies in interoperability. By mapping your data to a standardized JSON schema, you allow our Pattern Matcher to find connections invisible in raw text.

Step 1: Identify Your Domain

- NDE: Biological triggers, veridicality
- Ganzfeld: Sensory deprivation, information transfer
- Crisis Apparition: Spontaneous temporal synchronization
- STARGATE: Cognitive focus, remote sensing
- Geophysical: Tectonic pressure, EM anomalies

Step 2: JSON Mapping example attached to full documentation.

Best,
The Aletheia Team
