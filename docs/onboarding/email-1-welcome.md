Subject: Welcome to Project Aletheia | Onboarding for Data Custodians

Dear [Name],

Welcome to the first cohort of Project Aletheia. You have been selected as a Data Custodian because your research represents the level of rigor necessary to move anomaly studies from anecdote to evidence.

What is Project Aletheia?

We are not a "paranormal" forum. We are decentralized infrastructure designed to identify cross-domain patterns through standardized data. Our core hypothesis is that Stress Produces Signal - a pattern we have already observed from the scale of individual neurons (NDEs) to tectonic plates (Geophysical anomalies).

What makes a "Good" submission?

- Measurable Baselines: The "noise floor" of your environment or subject
- Stress Variables: Quantitative data on the pressure applied to the system
- Null Results: We value datasets that show no correlation just as highly as those that do

In the next email, we will walk through the technical schemas.

Best regards,
The Aletheia Team
