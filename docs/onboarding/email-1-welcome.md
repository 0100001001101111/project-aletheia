# Welcome to Aletheia - Data Custodian Onboarding

**Subject: Welcome to the Aletheia Data Commons**

Dear [Data Custodian],

Thank you for joining Aletheia as a trusted data custodian. Your research contributions are essential to our mission of creating reproducible, falsifiable knowledge about anomalous phenomena.

## What Aletheia Does

Aletheia is a "GitHub for Anomaly Research" - a collaborative platform where researchers contribute data that feeds into:

1. **Cross-domain pattern detection** - Finding correlations across NDE, Ganzfeld, crisis apparitions, remote viewing, and geophysical phenomena
2. **Falsifiable predictions** - Generating testable hypotheses from detected patterns
3. **Community verification** - Open testing with multiplicative quality scoring

## Your Role as Data Custodian

As a data custodian, you will:

- **Submit standardized data** using our five domain-specific schemas
- **Maintain data provenance** by linking to original sources
- **Respond to red-team flags** when methodological questions arise
- **Participate in jury duty** for disputed results (optional)

## What We Need From You

1. **Your existing datasets** - formatted to our schemas (see Email 2)
2. **Source documentation** - publication links, methodology notes
3. **Contact availability** - for clarification requests during triage

## Platform Features

- **LLM Parser** - Auto-extracts structured data from unstructured reports
- **Triage Scoring** - 0-10 quality score based on methodology, sourcing, documentation
- **Pre-registration** - Lock your methodology before testing predictions
- **Simple Mode** - Submit test results without statistics knowledge

## Next Steps

1. Read **Email 2: Schema Guide** to understand our data formats
2. Read **Email 3: Parser & Triage** to learn how submissions are processed
3. Complete the **Quick-Start Checklist** before your first submission

Welcome aboard. Let's build rigorous anomaly science together.

Best,
The Aletheia Team
