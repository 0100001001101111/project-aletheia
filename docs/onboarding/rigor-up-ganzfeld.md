# Rigor-Up Protocol: Ganzfeld

Turn your informal experiment into a Verified 10/10 submission.

1. Minimum Equipment
- Half ping-pong balls (taped over eyes), noise-canceling headphones, red light
- Two devices (Receiver records, Sender plays targets)
- Constant white or pink noise

2. Isolation (The "Roommate" Fix)
- Rooms separated by at least two walls
- Both parties wear headphones
- Use third party or randomized script to select target (double-blind)

3. Randomization
- Use True Random Number Generator, never subjective choice
- Dynamic video clips work better than static images

4. Documentation
- Record exact start/end time, Receiver Profile scores
- Transcribe mentation exactly as spoken, no editing

5. Instant Score Tankers (0.0)
- Any verbal interaction between Sender/Receiver before judging
- Shared Wi-Fi where Receiver could hear buffering
