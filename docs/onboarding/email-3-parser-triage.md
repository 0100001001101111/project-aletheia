Subject: The LLM Parser & The Triage Process

Dear [Name],

If your research is currently in field notes or narrative reports, we provide an LLM-powered Parser to digitize it.

Using the Parser:
1. Upload your text/PDF to the Contributor Dashboard
2. The Parser extracts key variables (Stress Index, Receiver Profile, Signal Modality)
3. You review and approve the generated JSON - the AI is a clerk, you are the scientist

The Triage Process:
- Your data is scored 1-10 based on methodology and completeness
- Score 7+: Verified status, enters the pattern matching network
- As your data helps confirm or refute predictions, you earn Credibility Points

Best,
The Aletheia Team
